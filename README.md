# PyBer_Analysis

## Approach


### Determine what kind of math is needed for each column of the summary frame
Total rides = COUNT of ride ID
Total Drivers = SUM of driver count in groupby
Total Fares = SUM of fares

Average Fares per ride = (Total fares)/(Total rides)
Average Fare per driver =(Total fares)/(Total drivers)

Merge series into new Dataframe
- update labels & formatting
